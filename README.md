# ðŸ‘€ Scrapi

Saw [this](https://www.dkriesel.com/spiegelmining) video on the CCC YouTube Account and wanted to scrape some data myself. So in order to do that, I wanted to build a platform which allows me to easily manage cronjobs to scrape data from a giving endpoint, save it and parse if needed.
